#Zinc

##About

  Zinc is an interpreted language made in Java using the Crafting Interpreters book. Many changes were made from the original lox version, such as the implementation of faster for loops, being able to run a script with arguments, and better variable assignment operators along with the caret for exponentation.

##Syntax

###Defining a variable
  Variables are defined using the `var` keyword. Zinc is dynamically typed, so any type can be put in a variable, even if it is different to the one it has already been assigned. 
Defining a variable looks like this:

```javascript
var x = 13;
var y = "String";
var z = clock();
```
